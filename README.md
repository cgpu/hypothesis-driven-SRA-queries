# Jupyter notebook-based tools for building structured datasets from the Sequence Read Archive

This repository implements a pair of Jupyter notebook-based tools that utilize the [MetaSRA](http://metasra.biostat.wisc.edu) for building structured datasets from the [SRA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) in order to facilitate secondary analyses of the SRAâ€™s human RNA-seq data: 
* *[Case-Control Finder:](https://github.com/mbernste/hypothesis-driven-SRA-queries/blob/master/case_control_finder.ipynb)* Finds suitable case and control samples for a given disease or condition where the cases and controls are matched by tissue or cell type.  
* *[Series Finder:](https://github.com/mbernste/hypothesis-driven-SRA-queries/blob/master/series_finder.ipynb)* Finds ordered sets of samples for the purpose of addressing biological questions pertaining to changes over a numerical property such as time. 

These notebooks currently utilize the MetaSRA version 1.6. 

Note, this repository was copied and modified from the following repository: [https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/RNA-Seq-in-the-Cloud/tree/master/Metadata](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/RNA-Seq-in-the-Cloud/tree/master/Metadata). These tools were developed at an NCBI computational biology codeathon in March 2019 held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

###  Setup

The dependencies for these notebooks are described in ``requirements.txt``.  Furthermore, before running the notebook, you must unpack the static metadata files from ``data.tar.gz``. To do so, run the following command:

``tar -zcf data.tar.gz``

To run the Case-Control Finder, run:

``jupyter notebook case_control_finder.ipynb``

To run the Series Finder, run:

``jupyter notebook series_finder.ipynb``
